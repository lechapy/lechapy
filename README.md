💼 About Me

 I'm an engineering student at the University of Valparaíso (San Felipe campus) 🇨🇱. I'm just getting started in the world of computer science, and I'm currently learning and building projects using Python.

I'm passionate about understanding how technology works and applying it to solve real-world problems. As I grow in this field, I’m exploring areas like:

    💻 Python programming

    🧠 Problem-solving through code

    🔍 Learning the fundamentals of computer science

    📚 Engineering and academic projects

I use GitHub to track my learning journey and share the small projects I build along the way. Open to learning, collaborating, and improving every day! 🚀
